Open the Case

Unscrew six screws around the back of the fish's case. Carefully open the case halfway and observe the mainboard with 5 headers on it. The case cannot be opened with the headers plugged in. Unplug all of the headers from the mainboard and finish opening the case.

Test the Motors

Test the fish's motors by building a circuit to power the moters. Build the following circuit to begin. (motor-test.fzz)

Now activate power to the motor to open the fish's mouth. Modify the circuit as follows. (motor-test-mouth-open.fzz)

Next, activate the motor to move the fish's head forward. (motor-test-head-forward.fzz)

Finally, activate the motor to move the fish's tail forward. (motor-test-tail-forward.fzz)
